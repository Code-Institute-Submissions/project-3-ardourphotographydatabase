# Ardour Photography Database

# Code Institute - Data Centric Development Milestone Project (3)

This Web Application functions as a Photography Database Gallery to showcase impressive photography works shared by Photographers to users including aspiring photographers and the general public. For aspiring photographers, the purpose will be to learn camera techniques or functions used by others through this cloud sharing platform. For the general public, it will be a leisure platform to view nice photography works and also an avenue for them to explore and hire good photographers.

The website aims to stimulate the photography ecosystem and allow photographers to be noticed through their works and for users to discover photography talents for their projects.

This website is inspired by my [User Centric Frontend Development Milestone Project (1)](https://deniseleechewwoon.github.io/project-1-ardourphotography/index.html) where it features Adour Photography - a fictitious Photography company that has existing photography talents. Hence, Adour Photography Database will be mandatory or highly encouraged to be used by Adour Photography's photographers to showcase their work to the general public. At the same time, it gives other colleagues a platform to share photography techniques.


The live site for this Project-Ardour Photography Database may be viewed [here](https://dlcw-ardour-photography.herokuapp.com/).

 
## UX

The target audience for the website will be
* Photography enthusiasts
* General public doing leisure browsing or looking for\photography talenst
 
In order to achieve the intent of capturing the viewers attention to the photography works that are showcased, the website aims to portray a very simple and minimalist feel. The use of blank space and clean minimalist icons to allow the viewer attention to be focused mainly on the photography works. A five-colour palette scheme consisting of mostly warm colours was maintained throughout the whole website design. This is consistent and evident through the the wireframe. A copy of the wireframe me be viewed [here](link).
 
Use this section to provide insight into your UX process, focusing on who this website is for, what it is that they want to achieve and how your project is the best way to help them achieve these things.
In particular, as part of this section we recommend that you provide a list of User Stories, with the following general structure:
- As a user type, I want to perform an action, so that I can achieve a goal.
This section is also where you would share links to any wireframes, mockups, diagrams etc. that you created as part of the design process. These files should themselves either be included as a pdf file in the project itself (in an separate directory), or just hosted elsewhere online and can be in any format that is viewable inside the browser.
## Features
In this section, you should go over the different parts of your project, and describe each in a sentence or so.
 
### Existing Features
- Feature 1 - allows users X to achieve Y, by having them fill out Z
- ...
For some/all of your features, you may choose to reference the specific project files that implement them, although this is entirely optional.
In addition, you may also use this section to discuss plans for additional features to be implemented in the future:
### Features Left to Implement
- Another feature idea
## Technologies Used
In this section, you should mention all of the languages, frameworks, libraries, and any other tools that you have used to construct this project. For each, provide its name, a link to its official site and a short sentence of why it was used.
- [JQuery](https://jquery.com)
    - The project uses **JQuery** to simplify DOM manipulation.
## Testing
In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.
Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.
For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:
1. Contact form:
    1. Go to the "Contact Us" page
    2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
    3. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
    4. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.
In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.
You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.
If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.
## Deployment
This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).
In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:
- Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
- Different configuration files?
- Separate git branch?
In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.
